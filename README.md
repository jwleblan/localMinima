# localMinima
Code demonstrating new ideas in detecting the minima of the log-likelihood

### Features

- Reproduces key results from the forthcoming publication "Testing for Local Minima of the Likelihood using Reparameterized Embeddings"
- 

### Running the code
- Download the [localMinima zip archive] from the [localMinima] website, and extract it. This should result in a directory called `localMinima`.

- Start Matlab

- On the Matlab prompt, go to the directory that contains the new ``localMinima `` directory, then run:

```matlab
% Reproduce key results (takes ~10-15 min)
localMinimaDetectionPoster()
```

- The code was run for 5000 Monte Carlo trials to get high resolution plots for publication (~2 hrs).
